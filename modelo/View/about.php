            <p class="info">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is an upcoming crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of various characters, players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of game modes, including a campaign for a single-player and multiplayer versus modes. Ultimate includes every playable character from previous Super Smash Bros. titles—ranging from Nintendo's mascots to characters from third-party franchises—and several newcomers.

The project plan for a new Super Smash Bros. game was finished in December 2015, during the development of 3DS/Wii U's downloadable content. Series creator and director Masahiro Sakurai returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed the previous game; the studios' return sped up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with Ultimate was to include every character from previous games despite the various development and licensing problems this would cause. Nintendo teased Ultimate during a Nintendo Direct presentation in March 2018, and officially announced it at E3 2018. It is scheduled to be released on December 7, 2018.</p>
